nbox
====

nbox is an XBMC skin that has been forked from the (apparently) stagnant development of tree_jammer's lightbox skin. http://forum.xbmc.org/showthread.php?tid=128852

##Goals

I have recently made the switch from the Boxee Box to a Raspberry Pi running Raspbmc and want a beautiful skin that is as simple and beautiful to use as Boxee was. Tree_jammer's lightbox skin is gorgeous, but it needed some tweaking and fixing up as it is only in alpha in order to make it functional and responsive in a Raspberry Pi.

Background fanart has been removed and any extra images have been removed. These may be added back in with time if the R-Pi can handle it.
